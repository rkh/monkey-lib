Some description goes here.

== Running the specs

Run specs with all backends:
  rake spec

Run specs with active_support:
  rake spec:active_support

Run specs with backports and using mspec instead of rspec (so it might work on incomplete ruby implementations):
  SPEC_RUNNER=mspec rake spec:backports
